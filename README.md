## Description

I am a movie & tv show lover but I do not know what I want to watch. I open watchopedia and search by (actor, tv show, or movie). The website populates results of the search. I can save some of those titles to favorites. 

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bulma
- JS
- TVMaze API (https://www.tvmaze.com/api)
- The Movie Database API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

## Usage Instructions
